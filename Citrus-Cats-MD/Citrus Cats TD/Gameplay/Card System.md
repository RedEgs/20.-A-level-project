### <u>How does the card system work?</u>
In Citrus Cats, cards a critical building block to how the game works. Basically any mechanic that can be "played" is a card. There are 3 main types of cards, these include: Tower cards (Cats and Citrus cats), Support cards (Boost certain attributes of towers) and Attack cards (Use specific one time abilities and attacks).  

#### <u>Tower cards</u>
*All the mechanics of towers can be found in and explained more in-depth in the [[Tower System]] page, if you want further details on the information relayed here.*

To elaborate further on what a tower card is, they are the main foundation of the game. When start your first run, you will be greeted with a screen that has a range of tower cards and lots of information on those tower cards. 

In the top-right of the tower cards, is its base level. This means the level that the card will start on when you place it down first. In the top-center is the name of the card, on the center of the card is a small thumbnail image of the towers sprite. On the backdrop of the whole card is a colored background of any kind. These colours relate to the towers element, and finally the frame of the card will tell you what type it is, whether that be support, attack or tower cards. In this case standard towers/cats will have muted natural but bold outline where as citrus cats towers or hero will have a bold, golden outline.

#### <u>Support cards</u>
In citrus cats, support cards are used to boost a range of attributes like attack speed, damage, crit-chance multipliers etc. Along with this towers can have thier own specific support cards which can only be used on either their towers with thier element(s), specific towers, citrus cats or attack types.

To compare support cards to another system in another game. Think of items in risk of rain 2. You pickup and use items to boost your characters strength, rather than linearly leveling up from 1-2 and 2-3 and so on, just to get a linear damage boost. Support cards prevent the game by getting boring by scaling certain attributes of your towers, exponentially, linearly, logarithmically, quadratically, and by the root.

On top of all of this cards of the same level and type can be "added" together to get the same card but higher level and a slight stat boost. These cards a fundamental to keeping your run going as long as it can so make to use them wisely.

#### <u>Attack cards</u>
Attack card are is a system that is unfamiliar to most tower defense players and is a mechanic unique to citrus cats. Attack cards give the player can give a player a kind of escape root in the middle of a round. 

When thrown down the card will use a temporary one time attack or one time large boost of some sort to do damage or scale towers much higher than normal. For example, if I had an bleed attack card and I threw it down when my towers were starting to fall behind, every tower on the map at that moment would lose half of its health past a certain threshold.
