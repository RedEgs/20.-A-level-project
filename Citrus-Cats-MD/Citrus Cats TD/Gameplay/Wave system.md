## <u>How does the wave system work?</u>
Just like in most other tower defense games the waves increase by one each time you survive or complete a wave. The amount of maximum waves is decided based on the difficulty chosen. It goes from 0 - 75 on easy difficulty, 0 - 100 on standard/medium and 0 - 125 on the hardest difficulty. 

To prevent the game becoming boring and prevent the game crashing or behaving unexpectedly, the game has a prestige system.

#### <u>Prestiges</u>
The prestige system is supposed to keep the game fresh and prevent your towers reaching an overflow value when reaching later rounds like 300. For every level amount of waves completed e.g 100 waves. You will unlock the ability to prestige or return to lobby. 

These prestiges start you back from wave 1 and reset all of your towers but now all of your towers start of with a percentage boost on all of thier base stats but this also applies to enemies. You can keep prestiging until you get bored or have set a new record but be aware that regardless of prestiging it is still possible to reach overflow values.
