### <u>How does the tower system work?</u>
In Citrus Cats TD the towers are unlike most other tower defense games in the fact you have a limited amount of towers able to be placed and limited possible variation of towers to choose from. 

Take Bloons TD 6 as an example. In the standard "endless" gamemode, you are able to place as many monkeys and as many variations of those monkeys as you so please. The only limiting factor being the space in which you place the monkeys and the money which you spend to place monkeys.

In Citrus Cats, you have a default limit of 4 base cats (towers) and 1 citrus cat, but upgrades up-to 6 cats are possible. They have to be 4 different cats meaning that you can't place the same cat multiple times or have the same cat in your arsenal. 

### <u>What makes the cats different to towers?</u>
*Technically and fundamentally the cats are no different to towers, so when talking about all cats including citrus cats (unless specified) technically I will refer to them as towers but in-game they are called cats. 

#### <u>Power System</u>
*It is technically possible to reach an number overflow value in damage but that would require extremely long playtime*

Again, I'll use Bloons TD 6 as an example to answer this question. What makes cats are different to just normal towers is that your cats will stay with you through out the game. You will continuously level them up and add various perks and traits to them to maintain their strength throughout your run. This system is similar to how roguelikes, like risk of rain 2, work. Your characters damage generally doesn't statically increase by itself, you add perks to increase your stats via percentages etc. 

#### <u>Applied damage types and attack types</u>
*By the way, (Applied) damage types and attack types are different. Damage types is damage like fire damage, lightning damage, water damage etc. Whereas attack types are melee, ranged, summon etc.*

##### Damage Types
In Citrus Cats their are various damage types, such as: fire, water, lightning, poison. These can be combined through various means like perks or when attacks simply collide with each other creating new/even more damage types like: Witchfire (Fire + Lightning),  Blaze (Fire + Water), Caustic (Fire + Poison), Acid (Water + Poison), Electricity (Water + Lighting), Toxic (Poison + Lightning). These damage types can be used to quickly destroy certain types of enemies. Due to the nature of these damage types they can be used to apply the effect of one type in the way of another.

For example, I'll use fire and lightning. Fire damage is slow and does small amount of bonus damage over time. Where as lightning is quick and a violent doing a large amount in the initial blast, this initial strike can also hit nearby enemies. Combine the two to make witchfire and you have a dangerous damage type which does a large amount of damage in the initial strike and medium amount of damage over time to aswell as hitting nearby enemies.

#### Attack types
Attack types are way simpler to understand as attack types is just the way the damage/damage type is applied. The various attack types include: melee, ranged and summoned. There are technically sub-attack-types like spreading (ranged), direct (could be any), splash (ranged/summoned) etc.


#### <u>Citrus Curses</u>
During your gameplay you will be able to make a "Citrus Curse" on any cat which will sacrifice something to allow your cat the be stronger in some aspect. As an example, I could make a citrus curse to decrease a cats effective range to 3m instead of 15m to increase the cats firing speed by 500%. These curses cannot be removed during your run at all. Selling the tower, or replacing the tower will not remove the curse. Bear in mind only 1 curse can be put on single tower.

### <u> Selecting your first towers. </u>
- Talk about rarity/element colour

### <u>Placing your first towers.</u>
*Let this part act more as a guide as apposed to a wiki, so you may want to bookmark this part or whatever.*

When placing your first cats, its important to understand that you don't have to place them all down straight away as your Citrus Cats are already very strong in base. Its also important to remember that you only get so many towers to begin so conserve them for the beginning parts of the game as it will be harder to manage 4 towers instead of 2 for example.
