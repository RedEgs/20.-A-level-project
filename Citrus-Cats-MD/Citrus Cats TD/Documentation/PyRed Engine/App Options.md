App options are used to assist with changing values that can only be changed on startup, for example resolution and fps. These values can be changed during runtime but are typically not because of UI scaling and various other issues. 

#### Current App Fields :-
- Resolution -
- V-Sync -
- Max-FPS -
- Window Title Name - 
- Window Icon Path - 

```
{ "app": { "settings": { "Resolution": "", "V-Sync": "", "Max-FPS": "", "Window Title Name": "", "Window Icon Path": "" } } }

```
